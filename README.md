# IDL

This repository implements a lexer and parser for YARP's Interface Description Language (IDL). Contents of this repository are used as a library by [`yarpc`](https://github.com/libyarp/yarpc) to parse definitions and build an AST that allows the compiler to generate sources in other languages.
